# BikeBuyersExcelProject

Analyzed a dataset of bike buyers. Datset contains columns for Marital Status, Gender, Income, Number of Children, Education, Commute distance to workplace, age and whether on not they purchased a bike, among others.

*First, the data was cleaned, which included removing null and duplicate values.
*Then, age brackets were made using the age columns using a nested IF function.
    0-30 -> Adolescent
    31-54 -> Middle Aged
    55+ -> Senior Citizens
*Pivot tables were then formed to summarize the data, and pivot charts were made using these tables.
*It is noticed that in general, males have a higher income than females and people with higher incomes are more likely to purchase a bike.

*Further analysis shows that as the commute distance increases, the likelihood of purchasing a bike decreases.
